# Make Sam Happy

## 🎭 About the Game

**"Make Sam Happy"** is an interactive AI-driven game where you take on the challenge of consoling **Sam**, an emotionally complex character struggling with deep sadness and loneliness. Sam's emotions shift between six states—**happy, sad, smirk, doubtful, emotionless, and angry**—based on how you interact with him.

Can you find the right words to **break through his emotional walls** and bring a genuine smile to his face?

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Engage in **real-time AI-powered conversations** with Sam.
- Choose your words carefully—Sam is **not easily cheered up**.
- Track Sam's **emotional state** as you try different approaches.
- Every response from Sam is generated dynamically, making each playthrough **unique**.
